CREST-Erlang

1. Introduction
This is a Web framework written in Erlang and supporting the
architectural style "Computational REST"; you can find informations
about the style at http://www.erenkrantz.com/CREST/ and about the
Master Thesis work that generated this application at
http://www.chimera-bellerofonte.eu/pubblicazioni/ (in Italian).

2. Certificates and Certification Authority
This framework requires SSL mutual authentication between peers; for
obtaining this, I have included an example certification authority with
a client and server certificate; beware that they have not been
released by a real CA, and both are provided for testing purposes only.
Real certificates should be provided when deploying a server running this
application.

The CA password is "crest", the server and client certificates passwords
are "peer".
